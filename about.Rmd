## McKaye

One reason I'm happy is   

because McKaye is my sister   

If she wasn't in the family  

I sure would have missed her   



McKaye plays a special roll  

She is the second to last  

With socks and sandals  

she runs really really fast 


Whether its leading the school  

or showing kindness at home  

Mckaye makes a good impact  

where ever she chooses to roam  


I'm sad im not there to  

celebrate with her this year   

I hope shes still is able   

to share lots of Christmas cheer  


Because I am not there

I want to share this site 

I am presenting my gift for her

with all my love and might
